<p>Syracuse, N.Y. —  In Syracuse, New York, there is a 30% gap between men and women, with a higher percentage of women falling at or below the poverty line in 2022, according to the <a href="https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B17001&geo_ids=16000US3673000,05000US36067,04000US36,01000US&primary_geo_id=16000US3673000#valueType%7Cestimate">U.S. Census</a>,. This imbalance is not only present in Syracuse but is also evident in Onondaga County, the state of New York, and the United States as a whole, representing the disproportionate impact of poverty on women in the country.</p>

<p>Under The <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html">U.S. Census</a>, poverty is determined if a family and all of its members’ collective income falls short of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html">specified threshold</a>. The poverty thresholds vary by family size and age of the members and are updated annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The income thresholds are uniform across the United States and do not vary based on geographical location.
</p>

<p>Sean J. Drake, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and a senior research associate in the Center for Policy Research with a research interest in poverty and homelessness, shared that there are multiple factors for this inequality, with the gender pay gap being one of them, especially in women of color. </p>

<p>“Women tend to face a wage gap as compared to other men, which can play a big role in gender discrimination,” Drake said. “Black women are often segregated in low-paying jobs that lack critical benefits, such as paid leave, health care, and retirement benefits. Lacking all of that in a job makes wealth-building a lot harder.”</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/#gender-pay-gap-differs-widely-by-race-and-ethnicity">Pew Research</a>, In 2022, men earned one dollar for their work while women earned only 82 cents for doing the same job in the US. These numbers represent a clear correlation between gender and poverty gaps.</p>

<p>Women working in lower-wage jobs don’t have benefits, including paid family leave, paid sick leave, or retirement options, Drake said.</p>

<p> “Not having those services and benefits impacts women more than they impact men because a lot of them sort of revolve around building a family and child-rearing,” Drake said. </p>

<p>Apart from the gender pay gap, parenthood and the roles that women play also contribute to this poverty gap. According to Pew Research, 70% of mothers between the ages of 25 and 34 had a job or were actively seeking one in 2022, compared to 84% of women of the same age without children at home. This 14% difference highlights the significant contribution it can make to poverty levels. Additionally, there is a contrast between women with kids and women without kids who are in the workforce. Compared to women of the same age who do not have children at home, mothers aged 25 to 44 are less likely to participate in the labor force and tend to work fewer hours per week when employed.  </p>

<p>Professor Drake suggests several measures that could be taken to address the poverty gap between men and women. </p>

<p>“The good news is that there are things that can be done at various levels of government to improve this address disparity and improve the situation. So, making things that are most expensive for people: housing, child care, health care, and education more affordable education,” Drake said.</p>


<p>These changes include making housing and childcare more affordable, for example, through universal pre-K programs, as well as improving healthcare access, especially in lower-wage jobs that are prevalent in rust belt cities like Syracuse. Student loan forgiveness is another important step, given that it disproportionately affects women, who often bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities. Furthermore, the lack of paid maternity leave is a significant issue that affects women more than men, exacerbating the gender pay gap. Professor Drake believes that implementing these measures could go a long way in reducing disparities and promoting gender equality.</p>

<p>Pew Research Center, on the other hand, suggests a different approach to closing, more specifically, the wage gap. The face tank suggests that the implementation of family-friendly policies in the United States may be hindering the closure of the pay gap between men and women. Although gender stereotypes and discrimination are challenging to measure, they seem to be some of the final obstacles preventing further advancement toward gender equality.</p>

<p>Another solution offered by Drake is for more people to participate in the political process.</p>


<p>“In a democracy, how do you change things? You change things by voting, period. That's how you do it. And so I think we have to promote and support candidates for office at different levels who are committed to addressing things like The gender pay gap or gaps in rates of poverty among men and women in the US. We have to be supporting candidates at the local level, the state level, and the national level who are sort of putting that issue as part of their platform,” Drake said.</p>
